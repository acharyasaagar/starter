# Why This Starter

This starter provides a well-documented foundation built around my own learnings, opinions, and preferences, designed to be reused across many future TypeScript projects. It acts as a personal go-to starting point for new work—whether personal, hobby, or exploratory—so each project begins with a familiar, consistent architecture instead of rethinking structure from scratch.

# What this starter should achieve

- Quickly launch new TypeScript projects with a solid foundation.
- Maintain consistent architecture and coding standards across diverse projects.
- Reduce decision fatigue by having pre-decided patterns and structures.
