# Why This Starter

This starter should serve as a reusable base for typescript projects. Its built around my own learnings, opinions, and preferences. It will act as a personal go-to starting point for new work—whether personal, hobby, or exploratory—so each project begins with a familiar, consistent architecture instead of rethinking structure from scratch.

# What this starter should achieve
